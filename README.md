# Palworld server tool

## Intro

This repository contains a Python script to reboot and back up the Palworld server.

The RCON feature may be introduced. But till now we haven't found how to connect to Palworld's RCON port through any Python libs.

- lib `rcon` was tested, but it didn't work :-(
- [ARRCON](https://github.com/radj307/ARRCON) worked, but that is a CLI tool.
